ember-present
==============================================================================

An addon for creating rich and interactive Ember.js presentations. Currently a work in progress.

**This addon is currently in an experimental phase with unstable APIs and no docs. I'll improve this soon.**

You can see my EmberConf talk which used this addon here:

## EmberConf 2018 Talk Source Code

I built this initial addon to power my [EmberConf 2018 "Smartphone Symphony" talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt9MRkf5Mus&feature=youtu.be&t=1h16m40s). There were many moving parts to this and I had a bit of a scramble trying to get everything working. I woke up early on the day of the talk and realised that I had made a set of changes the previous night that resulted in many parts of the talk no longer working. I scrambled to fix this by adding some polling, removing authorisation from the server and generally hacking the slides until things looked like they were working again.

The result of this is that the code quality of the addon and my talk is pretty poor. There are no tests, lots of half-baked ideas, inline styles and last minute hacks. I've learned lots from this experiment, and I'm planning on building the real high quality ember-present addon soon.

If you're interested, here is the source code to the presentation:
